This is where to post memos for the class each week.

### Reading: 
Students are expected to read and reflect on all of the assigned readings each week in advance of the relevant class session. 

### Memos: 
Every week, students will post one memo that explores the readings and associated topic relevant to their final project on artificial intelligence, innovation, and/or growth to our course GitHub site (also accessible through Canvas) by Thursday @ midnight prior to our class session. By 12pm Friday, each student will up-vote (“thumbs up”) what they think are the five most interesting memos for that session. The memo should be 300–500 words and include the following: (1) state their research question (for the final project) succinctly in a single sentence at the beginning (this can and should evolve across the weeks of the quarter as the project becomes more concrete); (2) propose a research design that helps to address that question, and not proposed in any prior memo, informed by at least one of the readings from the week; (3) a visual figure or diagam that draws upon pilot (nonhallucinated) data, simulated data with defensible assumptions, or provides a clear conceptual illustration that persuades the reader of the appropriateness and fruitfulness of the design to address the student’s question. Students are encouraged to use AI for writing/coding if helpful, but will be fully accountable for their memos and associated proposals. Even if students are involved in a group project, and their question is shared, the memos are separate and should reflect distinct research design explorations and possibilities. The TA and Instructors will project some of these visuals in class and study sessions for students to describe. Some of the top-voted memos may also form the backbone of our class discussion sessions.
